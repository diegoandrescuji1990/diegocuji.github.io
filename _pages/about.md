I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA in 2025, supervised by [Prof. Milica Stojanovic](https://millitsa.coe.neu.edu/). My research focuses on adaptive spatial signal processing techniques for wireless communications in Doppler-distorted underwater acoustic channels. During my doctoral studies, I was a research intern at Meta, Inc in 2020, Boston Scientific in 2021, and Apple, Inc in 2023. I earned a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University in 2019.
